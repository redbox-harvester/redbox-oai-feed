ReDBox OAI-PMH Feed  
===============
This project allows institutions to push data to the <a href='https://github.com/redbox-mint/oai-server'>OAI-PMH server</a>, by sending a JMS text message containing the expected JSON document format.

Installing
====
This project is an implementation of a <a href='https://github.com/redbox-harvester/json-harvester-client'>Harvester</a>, and has been configured to deploy inside a <a href='https://github.com/redbox-harvester/json-harvester-manager'>Harvester Manager</a>. 

To quickly install the entire stack, there is installer script tested with <a href='http://nectar.org.au/'>"NeCTAR CentOS 6.5 x86_64"</a>. Of course, this script comes with certain assumptions specific to the image, so you are certainly encouraged to modify the script to meet your needs. Run the ff. commands as root:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redbox-harvester/redbox-oai-feed/master/support/install/redbox_oaipmh_feed.sh
    chmod +x redbox_oaipmh_feed.sh 
    ./redbox_oaipmh_feed.sh 
 
Grab a cuppa as the script downloads the internets and sets up the Harvester Manager and the OAI-PMH Feed. 
 
If everything went well, you can view the server's available metadata formats here:

    http://localhost/oai-server/?verb=ListMetadataFormats     

You can also optionally <a href='https://github.com/redbox-harvester/redbox-oai-feed/blob/master/support/install/'>insert sample data</a>. You may run the ff. command on the same directory used on the previous commands:
    
    groovy addSampleRecord.groovy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redbox-harvester/redbox-oai-feed/master/support/install/sampleRedboxMintPeople.json

When running the command, you may have to wait for a few minutes as it downloads its dependencies. A couple of minutes or so after it finishes, you can then view the sample record at:
    
    http://localhost/oai-server/?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=eac-cpf 

You may modify the json file locally and rerun the command several times to test updates. The "recordId" uniquely identifies the record. Also, there are many sample files in the install directory so please check it out. 

That's it folks!
